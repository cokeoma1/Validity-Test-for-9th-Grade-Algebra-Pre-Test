The notebook in this repo contains script I wrote to help a 9th Grade Algebra teacher at a local high school determine if her pre-test was an appropriate challenge for her students. She was interested in metrics like item difficulty index (how many students are answering the question correctly), point biserial correlation (correlation betwen answering a question correctly and overall test score), and distractor effectiveness (how well incorrect options misled students). I delivered the visualizations in the notebook for her to determine if her test was appropiate at her discretion.
